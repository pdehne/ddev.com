DDEV makes it easy to install [TYPO3](https://typo3.org/) for local development. [Vite](https://vite.dev/) is a popular tool for frontend development due to its fast build times, hot module replacement, and optimized production builds. The [ddev-vite-sidecar Addon](https://github.com/s2b/ddev-vite-sidecar) together with the [Vite AssetCollector for TYPO3](https://github.com/s2b/vite-asset-collector) and the [TYPO3 Vite Plugin](https://github.com/s2b/vite-plugin-typo3) can be used to seamlessly integrate Vite with DDEV. Together they provide a modern and efficient environment for rapid TYPO3 frontend development.
